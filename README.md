## 5. Accessibility and best practices

* Use semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`).
* Provide `alt` attributes for all images (e.g. `alt="Portrait of Ho Chi Minh"`).
* Maintain sufficient colour contrast for text and background.
* Ensure the site is responsive by using relative units (%, em, rem) or media queries.
